## Commits convention

For any information on commit naming go to [cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13).

## Making changes

Main branch is protected from direct commits, so for any changes create a separate branch with proper naming **(<commit-convention>/<change>, example feature/new-input-system)** and open a pull request.

## Pull Requests

When opening pull requests provide a link to the [issue](https://github.com/features/issues) inside the pullrequest.

*PS: just start typing "#" and it will prompt openned issues.*
